# Classifying Reddit Posts with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

In this project, I scraped nearly 2000 posts combined from the subreddits r/personalfinance and r/financialindependence; two very similar yet different topics given their focus on one's finances, albeit from two very different perspectives. In the r/personalfinance subreddit, people often ask for advice on financial topics like setting up a checking account or how to get out of credit card debt. The r/financialindependence subreddit is generally people who have little to no debt seeking advice on how to retire at a young age. The language that people use in these subreddits is slightly different, so I thought I would be able to identify which subreddit any given post came from by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. I built a Random Forest Classifier, Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, and Logistic Regression Classifier to achieve over 90% accuracy when identifying which post a given subreddit belonged to.
